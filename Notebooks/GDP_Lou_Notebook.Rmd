This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

1. Using the `read_csv()` function, read the GDP dataset into your notebook as a tibble called `gdp_df`. After reading it in, inspect the first 10 rows and then inspect the last 10 rows. 

```{r}
gdp_df <- read_csv("../data/gdp_per_capita.csv")
```


```{r}
head(gdp_df, 10)
tail(gdp_df, 10)
```
2. Drop the 'Value Footnotes' column, and rename the remaining columns to 'Country', 'Year', and 'GDP_Per_Capita'.

```{r}
gdp_df <- gdp_df |> select(1,2,3)
head(gdp_df, 2)
```

```{r}
gdp_df <- gdp_df |> rename(Country = 'Country or Area', GDP_Per_Capita = Value)
head(gdp_df, 2)
```
3. Which years are represented in this dataset? How many observations are there per year? Make a plot to view the number of observations per year.

```{r}
years_in_data <- unique(gdp_df$Year)
years_in_data
```
```{r}
Obs_per_year <- gdp_df |> 
  group_by(Year) |> 
  summarise(Count = n()) |> 
  arrange(Year)

Obs_per_year
```
```{r}
ggplot(Obs_per_year, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
``` 
4. How many countries are represented in this dataset? Which countries have the fewest observations?

```{r}
countries_in_data <- unique(gdp_df$Country)
countries_in_data
```
```{r}
countries_in_data <- gdp_df |> 
  group_by(Country) |> 
  summarise(Count = n()) |> 
  arrange(Count)

countries_in_data
```


5. Create a new tibble by subsetting `gdp_df` to just the year 2021. Call this new tibble `gdp_2021`.

```{r}
gdp_2021 <- gdp_df |> 
  filter(Year == 2021) 

gdp_2021
```
6. Use `summary()` to find the summary statistics for GDP per capita in 2021.

```{r}
summary(gdp_2021)
```
7. Create a histogram of GDP Per Capita numbers for 2021 (you may wish to adjust the number of bins for your histogram).

|
```{r}
ggplot(gdp_2021, aes( x= GDP_Per_Capita)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)
```
8. Find the top 5 countries and bottom 5 countries by GDP per capita in 2021.

```{r}
gdp_2021 |> 
  arrange(desc(GDP_Per_Capita)) |> 
  slice_head(n=5)
```
```{r}
gdp_2021 |> 
  arrange(GDP_Per_Capita) |> 
  slice_head(n=5)
```
9. Now, return to the full dataset, `gdp_df`. Pivot the data for 1990 and 2021 (using `pivot_wider()` function) so that each row corresponds to a country, each column corresponds to a year, and the values in the table give the GDP_Per_Capita amount. Drop any rows that are missing values for either 1990 or 2021. Save the result to a tibble named `gdp_pivoted`.

```{r}
for_pivot <- gdp_df |> 
  filter(Year %in% c(2021, 1990))
for_pivot
```


```{r}
gdp_pivoted <- for_pivot |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = Year,
    values_from = GDP_Per_Capita
  )

gdp_pivoted
```
```{r}
gdp_pivoted <- gdp_pivoted |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  rename(year_2021 = '2021', year_1990 = '1990')

gdp_pivoted
```
10. Create a new column in `gdp_pivoted` named `Percent_Change`. This column should contain the percent change in GDP_Per_Capita from 1990 to 2021. Hint: Percent change is calculated as 100*(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value.

```{r}
gdp_pivoted <- gdp_pivoted |> 
  mutate(Percent_Change = 100* (year_2021-year_1990)/year_1990)

gdp_pivoted
```
11. How many countries experienced a negative percent change in GDP per capita from 1990 to 2021?

```{r}
gdp_pivoted |>
  filter(Percent_Change < 0)
```
19 Rows experienced a negative percent change from 1990 to 2021

12. Which country had the highest % change in GDP per capita? Create a line plot showing these country's GDP per capita for all years for which you have data. Put both line charts on the same plot.

```{r}
gdp_pivoted |> 
  top_n(2, Percent_Change)
```
```{r}
EGC <- gdp_df |> 
  select(Country, GDP_Per_Capita, Year) |> 
  filter(Country %in% c('Equatorial Guinea', 'China'))

EGC
           
```
```{r}
ggplot(EGC, aes(x=Year, y = GDP_Per_Capita, color=Country)) +
  geom_line()
```
13. Read in continents.csv contained in the `data` folder into a new tibble called `continents`. We will be using this tibble to add a new column to our dataset.

```{r}
continents <- read_csv("../data/continents.csv")
continents
```

14. Merge gdp_df and continents. Keep only the countries that appear in both data frames. Save the result back to gdp_df.

```{r}
gdp_df<- inner_join(gdp_df, continents)

gdp_df
```
15. Determine the number of countries per continent. Create a bar chart showing this.

```{r}
countries_per_continents_chart<-gdp_df |>
  group_by(Continent) |> 
  summarise(countries_per_continent = n())
  
countries_per_continents_chart
```

```{r}
ggplot(countries_per_continents_chart, aes(x= Continent, y= countries_per_continent)) +
  geom_col()
```
16. Create a boxplot showing GDP per capita in 2021 split out by continent. What do you notice?

```{r}
boxplot <- gdp_df |>
  filter(Year== 2021)

boxplot
  
```
```{r}
ggplot(boxplot, aes(x = Continent, y = GDP_Per_Capita)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
Europe has the highest GDP per capita while Africa has the lowest. There are outliers in every country except for South America. 

17. Read life_expectancy.csv into a tibble named life_expectancy. Do not modify the csv file in order to read this data in.

```{r}
life_expectancy <- read_csv("../data/life_expectancy.csv")
life_expectancy
```

18. Drop the Country Code, Indicator Name, and Indicator Code columns. Then use `pivot_longer` to convert your data from wide to long. That is, instead of having one row per country and multiple colums per year, we want to have multiple rows per country and a single column for year. After melting, rename the columns to `Country`, `Year`, and `Life_Expectancy`.

```{r}
life_expectancy |> 
  select(!Country Code, !Indicator Name, !Indicator Code)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
